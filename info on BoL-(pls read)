this project is called the bringers of light, we only wish the best for america and if you see one of us just say hi. this is pretty much a revolt against the government because, well, we ar anti-conservative, this is a gathering to fix this world and stop mother earths suffering, and bring the gods peace. so please, help us bring peace to everything once more for this realm has become full of greedy people who sill do whatever wherever they want. the gods all cry for peace and fate itself is feeling resentment for humanity unlike any other for one reasom, we are fighting ourselves and ending the age of humanity and at this rate we may all lose this buitiful home we call earth for what we are doing.
<br>even if we arnt gods but we wish to help them fix what needs to be fixed, for we wish to bring light to this darkened world and show that the light we wish to show everyone will not be extinguished, not even in passing on, nothing can stop light that has already shined, for there will always be one pearson or being whom sees the light that shined once and will continue to show ohers that light, one way that we shine is the kindness we can show, for kindness cannot be erased, there will always be kindness somewhere, and it is shared from pearson to pearson. thank you all for even readng this, have a good day, whenever someone seems sad, no matter what they look like, try to brighten up their day however you can.
<br><b>this is the brigers of light, thank you all for everything!<b/>
